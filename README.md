# TheGameThatPlaysItself
It's a game that plays itself, written in Tosh, open the program here: tosh.blob.codes/app
<br>
# Why Tosh of all things?
Simple, easy syntax, which is efficient for our purpose of this project and helps to make writing nessesary features or functions into the game with less of a hassle, we will try to make HTML versions of the game so you dont have to run it in an editor.
